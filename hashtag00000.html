<h2> Our Mission </h2>
<p>
    “We don’t like ourselves, so we don’t trust ourselves enough to support one another”- Lisa-Marie
    After hearing this statement I was inspired to prove them wrong. I want to show that it is possible to create cohesion in our communities. I created #00000, a platform that promotes black owned businesses, with that goal of creating togetherness within the African American community.
</p>
<h3>Why?</h3>
<p>
 “ The race who does not build is ALWAYS controlled by those who do.”-Trisha Legar Black businesses are vastly underrepresented as well as under funded. We want to build wealth for our people, while supporting the community in which we reside. The importance of supporting our own cannot be stressed enough. The main reason that we have a hard time accumulating wealth is because we are spending outside of our community, on big brands/chain stores. The buying power of African Americans is $1.1 trillion. How much of that money goes to black owned businesses? Only 2 two cents to every dollar an African American spends goes to black owned businesses.
